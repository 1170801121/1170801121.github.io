From Jul.1st, 2017 to Jul.20th, 2017, I volunteered as a scientific teacher in a summer camp in Nankangzhuang Village, Hebei Province, China. Our team consisted of 13 memebers. And our goal was to cultivate children's overall ability like cooperation and creativity. The figure below shows our team.

## During Summer Camp
In our team, my job was to excite children's interest in science. Firstly, I did some demonstrative physical experiments in the class. Then, I organized them to do some interesting experiments by themself. For example, in one experiment, they used a test tube to cover the candle, then they found that the candle died out and the water surface in the tube ascented, just like the following picture. After the experiment, they would be very curious about why it happened. Then, I may explained to them the reason behind it and they all thought it's wonderful. Cultivating their curiosity about the nature, I thought all my work was worthwhile.

## The end
During these 20 days, I had developed deep affection with them. We taught them how to cooperate with each other, and we played games with them. All of us thought it's quite an unforgettable experience in that summer.
