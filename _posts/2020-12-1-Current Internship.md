## Internship At ByteDance
Now I am doing an internship in a big technology company named Beijing ByteDance Technology Co., Ltd. As we know, TikTok, a popular app around the world, is developed by ByteDance. So I think it is a pretty good company.  

**I have been working at ByteDance as a software development engineer intern since Dec. 2020.** I enjoy my work and I plan to **continue this internship for at least the next three months.** 

The group I belong to is to develop the software in the field of finance analysis. My current job is highly related with knowledge graph construction, natural language processing, massive data computing, reasoning, and software engineering. **Highlights of my current internship are as follows:**

* Extracted entities (such as companies, employees, and stocks) and events from various companiesâ€™ reports, announcements and other news, and conducted sentiment analysis for the extracted events 
* Applied contrastive learning, distant supervision, and few-shot learning to mine relationships between the entities from context to enrich the knowledge base  
* Designed models to analyse the massive data to provide professional and intelligent predictions on the financial products such as stocks  
* Created web pages with HTML, CSS, JavaScript using Flask framework for users 

There I have applied many advanced technologies, **such as contrastive learning, distant supervision, and few-shot learning**, to address these tasks and launched my new models. Besides, I keep trying different methods and evaluate them through the online AB tests to achieve the best performance. I think that my work is very meaningful and solid.
